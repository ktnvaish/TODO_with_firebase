# TODO_with_firebase
includes firestore, firebase authentication and CRUD operations
This is a TO DO application which also incorporates user authentication module supported by firebase. 
It also utilises the firestore services for maintaining a database of tasks with respect to respective user IDs.
It supports all the CRUD operations and we aim to add a "forgot password" module into it very soon.
